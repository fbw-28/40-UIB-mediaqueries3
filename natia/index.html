            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>The story starts</strong>  with Alice sitting with her sister beside a lake. Suddenly,
                a white rabbit runs by. Alice runs after him. She finds his rabbit hole. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She falls through the hole. She meets many characters underground and has some amazing adventures.
                She grows larger or smaller by eating different things like cakes and mushrooms.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end, she enters a lovely garden. The Knave of Hearts is charged with stealing some tarts.
                A trial is held. Alice thinks the trial is ridiculous. She says so. Everyone is offended.
                There is a great commotion. Alice suddenly wakes up. She is back where she started, sitting with her sister beside the lake.
